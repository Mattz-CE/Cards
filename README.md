**Convenient Codes in MD Excusively for Matt**

### Written in:

- Batch:

> ### **Batch:**
> A batch file is a script file in DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a plain text file. A batch file may contain any command the interpreter accepts interactively and use constructs that enable conditional branching and looping within the batch file, such as IF, FOR, and GOTO labels. The term "batch" is from batch processing, meaning "non-interactive execution", though a batch file may not process a batch of multiple data.

### Some md helps:

* Text attributes _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`.
* ~~strikethrough~~
* Lists: site #3
1. Rest
2. Quarter Notes
3. An [example](http://example.com).

PS: I know this card is broken in pieces. This is the only card that's imbalenced.
